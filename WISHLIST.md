# WISHLIST

- [ ] allow specific discord roles as a target (eg `rainsail @sailors`)

- [ ] Additional options/parameters to the available actions (`balance`, `tipTOKEN`, `rainTOKEN`) to allow:

  * [ ] Specifying timeframes for actions (eg, like tips and rains being open for 20 min)

  * [ ] Random order or emojis needed for a reaction (to avoid bots)

  * [ ] If selected distribution mode is not FCFS ("first come first served") select _randomly_ to fairly distribute the tips (that is, if more reactions received than available tips... eg, 20 sail for 10 people, but 35 reacted). This is what the GiveAway Bot does, for instance

  * [ ] Allow users to create or contribute to pots (eg, UserA creates a big giveaway, UserB adds to that pot)

  * [ ] Check with community before settling on any syntax

- [ ] Additional actions, like:

  * [ ] Raffles

  * [ ] Dice
